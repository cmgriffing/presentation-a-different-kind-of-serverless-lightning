## Failure: GitHub Pages

- No Header access
  - Necessary for:
    - SharedArrayBuffer support
    - OPFS support
  - Possible workaround:
    - https://github.com/gzuidhof/coi-serviceworker
    - inconsistent due to loading and order of operations

## Bonus Hosting: Models

Cheap Provider via lowendbox.com

Why:
- Models can get large
- Predictable Bandwidth
- Just a file server via Caddy
  - Simple SSL/TLS
